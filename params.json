ICD-9 codes appear numeric but leading and trailing zeroes, and both decimal and non-decimal \"short\" format codes exist. The package enables a work flow from raw lists of ICD-9 codes from hospital billing databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 to comorbidity mappings from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included.\r\n\r\nICD-9 codes are still in wide use around the world, particularly in the USA where the ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) is in widespread use. ICD-10 and the corresponding ICD-10-CM are imminent, however a vast amount of patient data is recorded with ICD-9 codes of some kind: this package enables their use in R. A common requirement for medical research involving patients is determining new or existing comorbidities. This often get reported in *Table 1* of research papers to demonstrate the similarity of groups. This package is focussed on fast and accurate generation of this comorbidity information from raw lists of ICD-9 codes.\r\n\r\nICD-9 codes are not numbers, and great care is needed when matching individual codes and ranges of codes. It is easy to make mistakes, hence the need for this package. ICD-9 codes can be presented in *short* 5 character format, or *decimal* format, with a decimal place separating the code into two groups. There are also codes beginning with V and E which have different validation rules. Zeroes after a decimal place are meaningful, so numeric ICD-9 codes cannot be used in most cases. In addition, most clinical databases contain invalid codes, and even decimal and non-decimal format codes in different places. This package primarily deals with ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) codes, but should be applicable or easily extendible to the original WHO ICD-9 system.\r\n\r\nMain Features\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n-   assignment of patients to high level comorbidities based on admission or discharge ICD-9 codes\r\n    -   several mappings of ICD-9 codes to comorbidities are included (Quan, Deyo, Elixhauser, AHRQ)\r\n    -   very fast assignment of ICD-9 codes to comorbidities (using C++ internally)\r\n-   validation of ICD-9 codes\r\n-   summarizing ICD-9 codes into groups, and to human-readable descriptions\r\n-   conversion between different representations of ICD-9 codes, with and without a decimal point\r\n-   comprehensive tests to increase confidence in accurate processing of ICD-9 codes.\r\n\r\nNew since last CRAN release:\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n-   big performance increase: 1 million ICD-9 codes assigned to comorbidities in \\<1s\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSee the vignette for many more examples.
