ICD-9 code manipulation, validation and comorbidity generation in R
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ICD-9 codes are not numbers, and great care is needed when matching individual codes and ranges of codes. It is easy to make mistakes, hence the need for this package. ICD-9 codes can be presented in 'short' 5 character format, or 'decimal' format, with a decimal place seperating the code into two groups. There are also codes beginning with V and E which have different validation rules. Zeros after a decimal place are meaningful, so numeric ICD-9 codes cannot be used in most cases. In addition, most clinical databases contain invalid codes, and even decimal and non-decimal format codes in different places. Given these problems, this package offers the following main features:

 * validation of ICD-9 codes (decimal or non-decimal "short" form), including V and E prefixes
 * conversion of ICD-9 codes between decimal and "short" forms
 * allocation of cases (e.g. patients or patient visits) to standard groups of co-morbidities according to ICD-9 coding and arbitrary mappings of ICD-9 codes to co-morbidities
 * sorting of ICD-9 codes
 * generation of child codes from lists of higher-level ICD-9 codes

The initial release of this package contains ICD-9 to co-morbidity mappings from [AHRQ](http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidity/comorbidity.jsp). Since the data is provided in SAS source code format, this package contains functions to parse this SAS source code and generate R data structures. This processing is limited to what is needed for this purpose, although may be generalizable and useful in other contexts.

More detail can be found in the accompanying vignette, the thorough documentation of package functions, and by examination of the source code including the comprehensive unit tests.

Suggestions for improvement and contributions of code are very welcome. Contributions will be credited. I ask that, if you use this package for published work, you cite this work citation(package='icd9')
