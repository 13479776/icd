Package: icd9
Title: tools for working with ICD-9 codes, and finding comorbidities
Description: This package allows accurate manipulation, validation and
    comparison of ICD-9 (clinical modification) codes. Although ICD-9 codes
    appear numeric, this is not the case, since trailing zeroes, and a mixture
    of decimal and non-decimal "short" format codes exist. Tools to map ICD-9
    codes to co-morbidities are also provided, with one public domain mapping
    (programmatically derived from SAS code) from the AHRQ included.
