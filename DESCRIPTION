Package: icd9
Title: reading, analysis and manipulation of ICD-9 codes
Description: ICD-9 codes are not numbers, and great care is needed when
    matching individual codes and ranges of codes. It is easy to make mistake,
    hence the need for this code and test suite. ICD-9 codes can be presented
    in 'short' 5 character format, or 'decimal' format, seperating the code
    into two groups. Zeros after a decimal place are meaningful, so numerics
    cannot be used in most cases. This package enforces character specification
    to avoid mistakes. The package also provides a means of looking up which
    comorbidities exist in a patient given a set of ICD-9 codes, based on a
    mapping of ICD-9 codes to comorbidity groups specified in R. This entails
    parsing source SAS source code, and this is also included in the package,
    so that subsequent releases of SAS FORMAT data for comorbidities can be
    used.
