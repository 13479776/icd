\arguments{
\item{icd9Short}{is a character vector of ICD-9 codes. If fewer than
five characters is given in a code, then the digits are greedily assigned
to hundreds, then tens, then units, before the decimal parts. E.g. "10"
becomes "010", not "0010"}

\item{icd9}{is a character vector of ICD-9 codes. If fewer than five characters is
given in a code, then the digits are greedily assigned to hundreds, then
tens, then units, before the decimal parts. E.g. "10" becomes "010", not
"0010"}

\item{isShort}{single logical value which determines whether the ICD-9 code
provided is in short (TRUE) or decimal (FALSE) form.}

\item{invalidAction}{character string (unit length) containing one of:
"ignore", "silent", "warn", "stop"

- \code{ignore} no check for validity of ICD-9 code is made implicitly. This
is the fastest option. If the function call is explicitly to check validity,
e.g. icd9ValidShort(icd9Short = "12345", invalidAction = "ignore"), then the
behavior is the same as \code{silent}.

- \code{silent} invalid ICD-9 codes are replaced silently by \code{NA}
(actually \code{NA_character_}). If the function returns \code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE} rather than the ICD-9 code itself, then \code{FALSE} is returned

- \code{warn} invalid ICD-9 codes are replaced by \code{NA} with a warning
revealing the invalid code(s).

- \code{stop} stop with error if any invalid codes are found in input. This
is the preferred method when doing one-time validation, e.g. of the
co-morbidity mapping lists.}

\item{icd9Short}{is a character vector of ICD-9 codes. If fewer than
five characters is given in a code, then the digits are greedily assigned
to hundreds, then tens, then units, before the decimal parts. E.g. "10"

\description{
three digit codes are returned unchanged, one and two digit
  codes are preceded by 00 or 0.

Non-decimal ICD-9 codes with length<5 are often ambiguous. E.g.
  100 could be 1.00 10.0 or 100 if coded incorrectly. We must assume 100 is
  really 100
