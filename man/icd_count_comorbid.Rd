\usage{
icd9CountComorbidBin(x, visitId = get_visit_name(x), return.df = FALSE)

icd_count_comorbid(x, visit_name = get_visit_name(x), return_df = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame with one row per patient, and a true/false or 1/0 flag
for each column. By default, the first column is the patient identifier and
is not counted. If \code{visitId} is not specified, the first column is
used.}

\item{visitId}{Deprecated. Use \code{visit_name}}

\item{return.df}{Deprecated. Use return_df isntead. Single logical value, if
\code{TRUE}, return the result as a data frame with the first column being
the \code{visitId}, and the second being the count. If \code{visitId} was a
factor or named differently in the input, this is preserved.}
}
\description{
\code{icd_count_comorbid} differs from the other counting
  functions in that it counts _comorbidities_, not individual diagnoses. It
  accepts any data frame with either logicals or zero/non-zero contents, with
  a single column for visit_name. No checks are made to see whether visit_name is
  duplicated.
