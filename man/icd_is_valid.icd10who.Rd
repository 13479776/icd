From WHO ICD-10 manual: "The basic ICD is a single coded list of
three-character categories, each of which can be further divided into up to
10 four-character subcategories. In place of the purely numeric coding system
of previous revisions, the 10th revision uses an alphanumeric code with a
letter in the first position and a number in the second, third and fourth
positions. The fourth character follows a decimal point. Possible code
numbers therefore range from A00.0 to Z99.9. The letter U is not used (see
Section 2.4.7)."

"Although not mandatory for reporting at the international level, most of the
three-character categories are subdivided by means of a fourth, numeric
character after a decimal point, allowing up to 10 subcategories. Where a
three-character category is not subdivided, it is recommended that the letter
‘X’ be used to fill the fourth position, so that the codes are of a standard
length for data-processing."

officially, WHO standard goes to 3+1 digits, but there are officially
sanctioned extensions which use additional digits, e.g. neurology,
pediatrics, and of course ICD-10-CM.
