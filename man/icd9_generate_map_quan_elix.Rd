\title{Generate Quan's revised Elixhauser comorbidities}
\usage{
icd9_generate_map_quan_elix(condense = NULL, save = FALSE, path = "data")
}
\arguments{
\item{condense}{logical whether to condense the result ranges to the minimal
set of parent ICD-9 codes which exactly define the list. Defaults to
\code{FALSE} so that the saved list will allow rapid look-up of codes
without further processing. Small memory versus time trade-off.}

\item{save}{logical whether to save the result in the source tree. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{path}{path to directory to save the data. This is typically the data
folder in the devleopment source tree. Defaults to \code{"~/icd9/data"}.
Could possibly avoid hard-coding path with devtools functions.}
}
\value{
invisibly returns the list of vectors, where a
  co-morbidity name is associated with a character vector of ICD-9 codes.
}
\description{

  to include all possible ICD-9 codes.
