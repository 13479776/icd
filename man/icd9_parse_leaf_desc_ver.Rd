\description{
ICD9-CM data unfortunately has no comma separation, so have to
  pre-process. Note that this canonical data doesn't specify non-diagnostic
  higher-level codes, just the specific diagnostic 'child' codes.

  The file can be pulled from the zip files on the CMS web site or from
  within the package. Pulled data can be saved to the package development
  tree.
