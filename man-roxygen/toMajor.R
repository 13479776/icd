#' @param toMajor Most major codes are not \emph{real}, e.g. Salmonella 003 is a
#'   major category, but is not itself used as a diagnostic code. Therefore,
#'   strictly, asking for only \emph{real} codes excludes the major. We'll turn
#'   a blind eye to this if we specifically request majors with toMajor.
